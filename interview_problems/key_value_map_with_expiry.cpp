/*
  Implement the following two function

  void insert(int key, int val, long duration_ms);

  int get(int key)

  if the key has been in the map for a time longer than the duration then the
  get(int key) should return NULL

  After implementing this cleanup the map which has expired keys.

  Find time complexity of approaches. Consider scaling problem when writing the 
  solution
